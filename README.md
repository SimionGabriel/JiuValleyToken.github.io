# Jiu Valley records a lower share of effectively employed people than the rest of the country

The collapse of mining activities and the
corresponding drop in revenue had a significant
impact on the region’s overall employment level.
The region has long operated under a monoindustrial structure, with the hard coal mining
industry as the driving force behind most economic
activities.
Although this industry has been in a severe state of
decline in recent years, the area continues to exhibit
a high dependency towards mining activities, with
one third of families in the region relying on mining
as their main income source.
There remains a horizontal spill-over effect as the
coal fired power plants are located in the same
region with the fuel suppliers. Such developments
have impeded the region’s ability to establish a new
system of economic development.

# Tourism can lift the Jiu Valley out of poverty

Jiu Valley is surrounded by one of the largest
protected natural parks in Romania (Retezat
Natural Park) and a number of other natural
reservations (Natura 2000 sites).
The scenery is gorgeous, both inside the Jiu Valley
and around it.
Tourists come to the Jiu Valley during the winter to
ski and during the summer to enjoy the longest
mountain bike trails in Eastern Europe.
It would be a huge social benefit if the Jiu Valley
could attract more tourists, who stay longer and
consume more.
This could be achieved by gamifying the tourist
experience, for which is required the existence of
the Jiu Valley Token.
